A hash-keyed [token-curated registry (TCR)](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7). [Owner's Manual available](https://github.com/skmgoldin/tcr/blob/master/owners_manual.md).

## Initialize
The only environmental dependency you need is Node. Presently we can guarantee this all works with Node 8.
```
npm install
npm run compile
```

## Tests
The repo has a comprehensive test suite. You can run it with `npm run test`. To run the tests with the RPC logs, use `npm run test gas`.

## Composition of the repo
The repo is composed as a Truffle project, and is largely idiomatic to Truffle's conventions. The tests are in the `test` directory, the contracts are in the `contracts` directory and the migrations (deployment scripts) are in the `migrations` directory. Furthermore there is a `conf` directory containing json files where deployments can be parameterized.

## Deploying your own TCR
To deploy your own TCR, first open up `conf/config.json`. The `paramDefaults` object in the config JSON will specify the starting parameters your TCR is deployed with. In the `token` object, set `deployToken` to `true` if you want to deploy this TCR's token as part of the TCR deployment. You can specifiy initial recipients of the token in the `tokenHolders` array. If you have already deployed a token, set `deployToken` to `false` and provide the token's address in the `address` property. The token should be EIP20.

The `package.json` includes scripts for deploying to rinkeby and mainnet. Modify `truffle.js` and `package.json` if you need other networks. You'll need a `secrets.json` file with a funded mnemonic on the `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` HD path in the root of the repo to deploy. Your `secrets.json should look like this:
```
{
  "mnemonic": "my good mnemonic"
}
```
You can use [https://iancoleman.io/bip39/](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate a mnemonic and derive its `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` address.

## Packages
The repo consumes several EPM packages. `dll` and `attrstore` are libraries used in PLCRVoting's doubly-linked list abstraction. `tokens` provides an ERC20-comaptible token implementation. All packages are installed automatically when running `npm install`.
